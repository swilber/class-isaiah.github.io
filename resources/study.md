# **Week 1: Introduction to the Book of Isaiah**  
## **Summary**  
The introduction to Isaiah establishes the book’s framework, detailing its structure, historical context, authorship, textual reliability, and theological significance. Isaiah 1–39 focuses on judgment and hope amid Judah’s 8th-century BC struggles with Assyrian threats, 40–55 offers comfort and the Suffering Servant post-exile, and 56–66 envisions new creation and ethics, unified by God’s sovereignty and Messianic promises fulfilled in Jesus (John 12:41). Set during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah (740–680 BC), Isaiah addresses Judah’s spiritual decline and geopolitical pressures, paralleling modern crises and urging trust in God’s plan.  
Authorship is traditionally attributed to Isaiah son of Amoz, supported by thematic unity and the Great Isaiah Scroll (1QIsa^a, ~125 BC), which confirms textual reliability against multiple-author theories. Theologically, Isaiah’s themes of holiness (ch. 6), Servant songs (ch. 53), and new creation (ch. 65–66) point to Christ, calling men to holiness and courage in crises, with the Dead Sea Scrolls reinforcing confidence in Scripture’s Messianic promises.

# **Week 2: Isaiah 1–6 (Indictment, Vision, and Early Prophecies)**  
## **Summary**  
Isaiah 1–6 opens with a courtroom-style indictment of Judah’s covenant rebellion (1:2–20), set against 8th-century BC Assyrian threats during Uzziah’s reign, exposing idolatry and social injustice. Chapters 1–5 detail Judah’s spiritual decay, while Chapter 6’s throne-room vision (740 BC, Uzziah’s death) reveals God’s holiness, the divine council with seraphim, and Isaiah’s commissioning to a resistant people, foreshadowing Christ’s glory (John 12:41).  
The “Branch of the Lord” (4:2–6) introduces Messianic hope, promising purification fulfilled in Jesus (Jeremiah 23:5). This section contrasts human sin with divine glory, urging repentance and holiness, challenging men to confront modern “idols” (e.g., ambition, status) and embrace God’s call with vulnerability and integrity.

# **Week 3: Isaiah 7–12 (Immanuel and the Messianic King)**  
## **Summary**  
Isaiah 7–12 addresses Judah’s crisis during the Syro-Ephraimite War (734–732 BC), where Ahaz faces threats from Israel and Syria, prompting Isaiah to urge trust in God over Assyrian alliances (2 Kings 16). The Immanuel prophecy (7:14) promises a child as a sign of God’s presence, with dual fulfillment in a near-term birth (e.g., Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz, 8:3) and Jesus’ virgin birth (Matthew 1:23), clarified by Heiser’s analysis of “almah.” Chapters 9:6–7 and 11:1–9 envision a Davidic king with titles like “Wonderful Counselor,” bringing justice and peace, fulfilled in Christ.  
This section contrasts Ahaz’s fear with divine faithfulness, emphasizing Messianic hope. It challenges men to reject worldly “alliances” (e.g., career, status) and lead with courage, modeling Christ’s kingship in crises.

# **Week 4: Isaiah 13–20 (Oracles Against the Nations, Part 1)**  
## **Summary**  
Isaiah 13–20 delivers oracles of judgment against nations like Babylon, Philistia, Moab, Damascus, and Egypt, set against 8th-century BC Assyrian dominance, affirming God’s sovereignty over human empires. Isaiah 14:12–15’s “morning star” may hint at Satan’s fall, per Heiser, while 19:23–25 envisions a Messianic future where Egypt and Assyria worship with Israel, fulfilled in the gospel’s spread (Acts 2).  
These chapters emphasize God’s justice and universal redemption, challenging men to reject prideful “empires” (e.g., career, culture) and trust in God’s plan. The oracles shift from historical judgments to eschatological hope, inspiring humility and faith in Christ’s inclusive kingdom.

# **Week 5: Isaiah 21–27 (Oracles and Little Apocalypse)**  
## **Summary**  
Isaiah 21–27 transitions from oracles against nations like Babylon and Tyre (ch. 21–23) to the “little apocalypse” (ch. 24–27), depicting global ruin amid 8th-century BC threats, escalating to cosmic judgment foreshadowing exile. The “little apocalypse” portrays earth’s desolation (24:1–6), followed by a Messianic banquet on Mount Zion (25:6–8), where death is swallowed up, fulfilled in Christ’s resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:54).  
Isaiah 26:19 hints at bodily resurrection, leading to praise in ch. 27, tying historical deliverance to eschatological renewal. This section emphasizes judgment’s scope and hope’s triumph, encouraging men to trust God’s ultimate restoration in crises, paralleling modern challenges with Christ’s victory.
