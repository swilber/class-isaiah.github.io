    "studyApproach": "This 12-week study of Isaiah combines verse-by-verse exegesis with historical context and Messianic fulfillment. Each week includes preparation through Motyer's commentary, Oswalt's video lectures, and supplementary resources, followed by group discussion of key themes. The study emphasizes Isaiah's three-part structure (judgment/hope in chs. 1-39, comfort/Servant in chs. 40-55, and ethics/new creation in chs. 56-66), connecting 8th-century BC historical events to Christ's fulfillment. Participants engage with maps, images, and archaeological evidence while applying Isaiah's calls for faith, justice, and hope to modern leadership and discipleship challenges."

      "summary": "The introduction to Isaiah establishes the book’s framework, detailing its structure, historical context, authorship, textual reliability, and theological significance. Isaiah 1–39 focuses on judgment and hope amid Judah’s 8th-century BC struggles with Assyrian threats, 40–55 offers comfort and the Suffering Servant post-exile, and 56–66 envisions new creation and ethics, unified by God’s sovereignty and Messianic promises fulfilled in Jesus (John 12:41). Set during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah (740–680 BC), Isaiah addresses Judah’s spiritual decline and geopolitical pressures, paralleling modern crises and urging trust in God’s plan.  \nAuthorship is traditionally attributed to Isaiah son of Amoz, supported by thematic unity and the Great Isaiah Scroll (1QIsa^a, ~125 BC), which confirms textual reliability against multiple-author theories. Theologically, Isaiah’s themes of holiness (ch. 6), Servant songs (ch. 53), and new creation (ch. 65–66) point to Christ, calling men to holiness and courage in crises, with the Dead Sea Scrolls reinforcing confidence in Scripture’s Messianic promises.",
