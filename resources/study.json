    "studyApproach": "This 12-week study of Isaiah combines verse-by-verse exegesis with historical context and Messianic fulfillment. Each week includes preparation through Motyer's commentary, Oswalt's video lectures, and supplementary resources, followed by group discussion of key themes. The study emphasizes Isaiah's three-part structure (judgment/hope in chs. 1-39, comfort/Servant in chs. 40-55, and ethics/new creation in chs. 56-66), connecting 8th-century BC historical events to Christ's fulfillment. Participants engage with maps, images, and archaeological evidence while applying Isaiah's calls for faith, justice, and hope to modern leadership and discipleship challenges."

      "summary": "The introduction to Isaiah establishes the book’s framework, detailing its structure, historical context, authorship, textual reliability, and theological significance. Isaiah 1–39 focuses on judgment and hope amid Judah’s 8th-century BC struggles with Assyrian threats, 40–55 offers comfort and the Suffering Servant post-exile, and 56–66 envisions new creation and ethics, unified by God’s sovereignty and Messianic promises fulfilled in Jesus (John 12:41). Set during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah (740–680 BC), Isaiah addresses Judah’s spiritual decline and geopolitical pressures, paralleling modern crises and urging trust in God’s plan.  \nAuthorship is traditionally attributed to Isaiah son of Amoz, supported by thematic unity and the Great Isaiah Scroll (1QIsa^a, ~125 BC), which confirms textual reliability against multiple-author theories. Theologically, Isaiah’s themes of holiness (ch. 6), Servant songs (ch. 53), and new creation (ch. 65–66) point to Christ, calling men to holiness and courage in crises, with the Dead Sea Scrolls reinforcing confidence in Scripture’s Messianic promises.",

        "Historical Context: Isaiah prophesied around 740-680 BC during the reigns of kings Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, with Judah facing Assyrian aggression (e.g., 701 BC siege) and the threat of Babylonian exile (586 BC), as cross-referenced in 2 Kings 15–20.",
        "Authorship: The traditional view, supported by Motyer and Oswalt, attributes the book to a single author, Isaiah son of Amoz, divinely inspired, while addressing critical theories of multiple authors through evidence of unified themes and prophetic foresight, as discussed in Heiser’s podcast.",
        "Dead Sea Scrolls: Discovered in 1947 at Qumran, the Great Isaiah Scroll (1QIsa^a, dated around 125 BC) is nearly complete and closely matches the Masoretic Text, providing strong evidence for textual reliability with only minor variants that do not affect theology, as noted in Motyer (pp. 25-27) and Heiser’s blog.",
